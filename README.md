# About Cserkész10

#### Cserkész10 _(Scout10)_ is an app that helps you learn more about and practice the ten scout laws.

I made this app for the use of Hungarian scouts and to learn new things about Android development. Cserkész10 is free and is not designed to generate revenue.

The app has several **main features**:
- A list of scout laws and their explanations both in a contemporary form and as written by B-P. a hundred years ago
- Three types of quizzes that help you practice the scout laws while having fun
- Customizable notifications to make sure you do not forget about is ;)

The app also has:
- Animations!
- A score system and time records
- Free cakes! (not actually)

Download Cserkész10 from the Playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.b4kancs.scoutlaws

In case you do not speak Hungarian, follow these steps to make the app interface speak **English**:
1. Click on the 4th menu item in the navigation drawer ('Az appról').

2. Click 5 times on the description text area.

You can now (hopefully) understand what's going on! These changes are not retained between app sessions.
